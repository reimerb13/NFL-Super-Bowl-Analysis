# NFL Super Bowl Analysis

# Project Summary

The purpose of the project was to analyze data from all 57 Super Bowls that have been held by the NFL and projecting
point totals that Super Bowl winners and losers will score in the upcoming 15 Super Bowls. This project does not account
for plays run by Super Bowl teams, as well as any penalities that occurred.

# Data Collection

There were two data sets used to complete the analysis. The first dataset was created by Timo Bozsolik titled 'Super Bowl History 1967-2020'. This dataset included data from Super Bowls that were held between 1967 and 2020. The second dataset was one that I created that included Super Bowl data from 2021-2023.

# Super Bowl Data

The 'Super Bowl History 1967-2020' dataset contained 54 observations and 10 variables. 8 of the 10 variables were considered 'character' and 2 of the variables were considered 'integer'.
